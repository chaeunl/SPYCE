# SPYCE v.0.0
SPYCE is an interface for Python and HSPICE to reduce the effort to organize large system or circuit. Instead of arranging circuits and labeling each node to connect circuits, SPYCE automatically arranges circuits and labels nodes when users make circuits conntected.

SPYCE is used in SEMULATOR [1].
